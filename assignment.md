Implementing SCRUM will allow the IT Team to have clearer goals, and by implementing sprints each with defined milestones, the IT team will be able to have a feeling of progress as each sprint is completed. As each new feature being deployed, the team will also be able to get quick feedback on the new deployments features, as users begin to use the system. Users can provide timely feedback on whether the solution is suitable, user friendly, aesthetic or require further adjustments. Scrum also allows each team member to be aware of what each other are doing, and when a team member brings up that they encountered a roadblock, they will be able to offer their expertise and experience.
